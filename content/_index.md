I'm a PhD student at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) in Computer Science, supervised by [Alice Toniolo](https://at258.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) and [Miguel Nacenta](http://nacenta.com), and part of [SACHI](https://sachi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/people/).

### üî≠ Building tools for forecasting and thinking

I'm interested in the potential of software tools to help people make more accurate probabilistic forecasts.

Often when we are making decisions, it's based on what we expect their consequences to be. So if we can improve our ability to predict future events, we can make better decisions.

I think better forecasting may help us [reduce global catastrophic risks](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/forecasting/), so I'm exploring the potential of tools to improve the forecasting process.

I'm designing a tool for forecasters and thinkers to progressively externalise their mental models, fluidly move between and create formalisms, and share their thinking with the community.

### üó∫Ô∏è Studying transformations between representations

[üìú Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2022.102851) // [‚úçÔ∏è Project page](https://adambinks.me/write-reason)

To support the design of tools for forecasting and thinking, I'm interested in how representations (like diagrams and visualisations) can affect the way we think, and what kinds of structures we discover.

Lots of great work has been done on the content of representations. But I think it's also worth looking at how we *transform*, or move between, representations.

I made [Write Reason](https://adambinks.me/write-reason), a tool to study transformations. It combines a text editor and a mapping interface.


### üß† Improving rationality

I'm a researcher at [Clearer Thinking](https://clearerthinking.org/). I build interactive tools, run studies, and write articles, to help people improve their rationality and achieve their goals.

I wrote about [what AI can do, what it can‚Äôt do, and what‚Äôs coming](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/what-ai-can-do-what-it-can-t-do-and-what-s-coming).


### üóª Building a tool for goal tracking

[üßó Project page](https://adambinks.me/goal-tracker/)

I'm also working on a tool for tracking your goals. The idea: track how your daily to-do list contributes to your ultimate life goals and intrinsic values.

### üí° Effective Altruism

I'm fascinated by the project of [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/). I help run [EA St Andrews](https://www.eastandrews.org/).

I co-founded [One for the World: St Andrews](https://www.facebook.com/OneForTheWorldStAndrews). It's a community where we pledge to give a portion of our future income to *highly effective* charities, based on research from [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/).
